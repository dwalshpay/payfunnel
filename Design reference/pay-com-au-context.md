## Company Overview

**pay.com.au** is Australia's leading business payments platform that enables businesses to pay ANY expense using credit cards (even when suppliers don't accept cards) while earning rewards points. The platform acts as an intermediary - businesses pay through pay.com.au with their credit card, and pay.com.au pays the supplier via bank transfer.

**US Brand**: PayRewards (for US market expansion)

## Core Value Proposition

### The "Double-Dip" Concept (Key Messaging)
The central value proposition is the ability to **earn points twice** on every payment:
1. **Credit card points** - From the user's existing rewards credit card (Amex, Qantas, etc.)
2. **PayRewards Points** - pay.com.au's own loyalty currency earned on top

### The "Triple-Dip" (Advanced Users)
Pay credit card bills via bank transfer through pay.com.au to earn PayRewards on that payment too.

### Key Problems Solved
- **Suppliers don't accept credit cards** → pay.com.au bridges this gap
- **Government/ATO payments earn reduced points** → Full points via pay.com.au
- **Payroll can only be paid by bank transfer** → Earn PayRewards on bank transfers
- **Cash flow constraints** → Access up to 55 days interest-free using credit card float
